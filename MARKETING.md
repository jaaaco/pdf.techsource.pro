You’ve built something genuinely useful: offline, client-side, privacy-first PDF tooling is catnip for a certain kind of internet brain. The trick is to put it where those brains already hang out and to frame it correctly. Here are ten zero-budget, time-only ways to get real traffic.

First: turn privacy into a story, not a bullet point.
Write a short article titled something like “Why I built a PDF tool that never uploads your files”. Publish it on Medium, Dev.to, or even a GitHub README discussion. People don’t share tools, they share motives: privacy anxiety, corporate overreach, “I got tired of shady PDF sites”.

Second: weaponize comparison posts.
Write blog posts or docs like “Offline PDF compression vs iLovePDF / SmallPDF”. Be fair, factual, and calm. Search engines love comparisons, and users already searching for those tools will stumble onto you.

Third: Reddit, but like a human.
Post in subreddits where privacy and tooling overlap: r/privacy, r/selfhosted, r/webdev, r/opensource. The key move: don’t say “I made a tool”. Say “I wanted a PDF compressor that doesn’t upload files, so I built one” and link at the end. Include a GIF or short demo if allowed.

Fourth: Hacker News, with the right angle.
Submit it as “Show HN: Client-side PDF tools using WASM, no uploads”. Hacker News is allergic to marketing but loves WASM, privacy, and clean engineering. Expect brutal comments. They are free QA and free traffic.

Fifth: SEO via boring pages.
Create one simple page per verb:
	•	/compress-pdf-offline
	•	/merge-pdf-browser
	•	/ocr-pdf-client-side

No fluff. Clear headings. Plain language. Google rewards clarity more than hype, especially for utility searches.

Sixth: Turn GitHub into a landing page, not a graveyard.
Add:
	•	a short animated GIF demo
	•	“Why this exists” section
	•	“Who should use this / who shouldn’t”

Then tag it properly. GitHub stars don’t pay rent, but they feed discoverability and trust.

Seventh: Product Hunt, but late and calm.
Don’t launch with fireworks. Post it as a “quiet utility tool” and engage honestly in comments. Product Hunt traffic is short-lived, but backlinks and social proof stick around.

Eighth: Answer questions where PDFs are a pain.
Stack Overflow, Superuser, Quora, Reddit comments. When someone asks “How do I compress a PDF without uploading it?”—that’s your cue. Be helpful first, link second. This compounds over months.

Ninth: Build a tiny demo playground.
A page called “Try it on a 5-page sample PDF (no upload)”. People are suspicious. Let them test without committing their own files. This massively boosts conversion and sharing.

Tenth: Lean into “offline” and “works on planes”.
That’s a niche but a loud one. Write a post like “PDF tools that work with no internet (tested on airplane mode)”. Digital nomads, lawyers, journalists, and paranoid engineers will bookmark it.

Underlying principle:
You’re not selling a PDF tool. You’re selling control. Control over data, over workflow, over not trusting random websites with tax returns and contracts. Frame everything around that, and traffic comes as a side effect.

If you want, the next logical step is mapping each feature to a single search intent and writing one ruthlessly clear page per intent. That’s slow, unglamorous, and devastatingly effective.
